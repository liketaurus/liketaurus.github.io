##Wow! It works!

After one and a half days of investigations and developing my own Jekyll blog client - [Post Editor] is working and almost usable.

This simple program let you to do the following:
* login to your GitHub account
* choose a repository and a directory for your blog posts
* the program build a filename in Jekyll style and add a header to it automatically
* write your post (in Markdown or HTML) and post it to GitHub

Take a first look at [very early release].

A lot of further work is planning and coming...
